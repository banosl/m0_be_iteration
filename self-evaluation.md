# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
  * I'm feeling really confident. Going through the exercises as a group using the driver/navigator format really helped me grasp the method.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  * When we were doing the practice problems, particularly the one where we needed to write a code that only printed out the numbers in 10 I was immediately trying to find a method that did that. It wasn't until Issa suggested using the if, then statement that it clicked. I can really tap into any of the material we've covered in Mod0 to do the assignment. It's not just using what is being covered in the moment, but all of what we know. I probably would have struggled a bit to make the connection if it hadn't been worked out in group.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * Learning more methods is what I want to focus on next. I'm excited to see what codes I can write even with my burgeoning knowledge once I understand some more methods.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * I'm thinking back to that '10,000 emails' example that Mike brought up. How would I actually create an array with that many elements. It's not something you'd type out. So I'm interested to see how the code can be modified to pull data from somewhere else and turn it into an array that can be manipulated. It's exciting.
